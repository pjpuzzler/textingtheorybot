TextingTheory Bot is a Devvit-powered Reddit app for r/TextingTheory that analyzes images of text conversations, generates a stylized review image, and posts a detailed "Game Review" comment. It leverages Google Gemini for AI analysis and a custom renderer for visuals.

## Features

- **Automatic Analysis:** Detects new image posts and analyzes the conversation using Google Gemini.
- **Stylized Image Generation:** Renders a unique, visually appealing image of the chat.
- **Game Review Comments:** Posts a rich comment with insights, stats, and the rendered image.
- **Custom Annotations:** Users can submit their own analysis if the bot's isn't quite right.
- **Elo Voting:** Community members can vote on the Elo rating for posts using `!elo` commands.

## How It Works

1. **New Post Detection:** The bot monitors r/TextingTheory for new image posts.
2. **AI Analysis:** Google Gemini analyzes the conversation for context, sides, and move quality.
3. **Image Rendering:** A Python script generates a stylized image of the conversation.
4. **Review Comment:** The bot posts a detailed comment with the image, stats, and insights.
5. **User Interaction:** Users can submit their own annotations or vote on Elo ratings.
